#### 1. Stressful Subject
The function should recognise if a subject line is stressful. A stressful subject line means that all letters are in uppercase, and/or ends by at least 3 exclamation marks, and/or contains at least one of the following “red” words: "help", "asap", "urgent". Any of those "red" words can be spelled in different ways - "HELP", "help", "HeLp", "H!E!L!P!", "H-E-L-P", even in a very loooong way "HHHEEEEEEEEELLP," they just can't have any other letters interspersed between them.
